### 5.2-1
- In HIRE-ASSISTANT, assuming that the candidates are presented in a random order,   what is the probability that you hire exactly one time? What is the probability
  that you hire exactly n times?

```
Hiring one time must when best candidate come first..
```
$$\text{leaving }(n-1)! \text{ ordering for the rest of them}\\
P={(n-1)!\over (n)!} = {1\over n}$$

```
Hiring all of them must when them come in increasing order, and it would be exactly one order of the n! possible orders..
```
$$P={1\over n!}$$
