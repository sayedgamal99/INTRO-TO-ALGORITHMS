# Chapter Three Notes:

- Once the input size n
    becomes large enough, merge sort, with its $\Theta(nlgn)$ worst-case running time,
    beats insertion sort, whose worst-case running time is $\Theta(n^2)$

- Asymptotic notation can also apply to
    functions that characterize some other aspect of algorithms (the amount of space
    they use, for example), or even to functions that have nothing whatsoever to do
    with algorithms

- the next figure illustrate the difference between "Big-oh","Theta" and "Big-Omega"
    notations:
